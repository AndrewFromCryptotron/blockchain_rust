Parse the Rust code of the smart contract: I would use a Rust parsing library to turn
the source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the structure of 
the program in a way that's easy for my tool to analyze.

Analyze the AST: I would traverse the AST, looking for particular structures that 
correspond to the rules I'm interested in. For example, look for function 
definitions with particular names, unsafe blocks, certain kinds of loops, or other code 
structures.

Validate the smart contract: Based on analysis, I would determine whether the smart 
contract is valid according to protocol rules. If it's not, it would return a list of errors 
or warnings indicating what's wrong with the contract.
