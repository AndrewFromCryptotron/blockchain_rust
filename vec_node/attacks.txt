Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: These attacks aim to make your service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. In a p2p network, an attacker could potentially target specific nodes to disrupt the network.

Eclipse Attacks: In this attack on a p2p network, the attacker aims to isolate a node or nodes from the rest of the network, essentially taking control of all the victim's connections.

Sybil Attacks: In this type of attack, an attacker creates many fake identities in a p2p network in order to influence the network's operation. In a blockchain context, this could mean an attacker trying to gain control of a majority of nodes to manipulate consensus.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: An attacker could potentially intercept and alter communication between nodes in your network.

Replay Attacks: An attacker could potentially intercept network communications and then replay them, leading to potential double-spends in a blockchain context.
