# Vector

Welcome to Vector, my blockchain solution designed in pure Rust. This project leverages the efficiency and concurrency of Rust alongside gRPC (protobuf) for network communication, and a custom PBFT-like consensus mechanism to ensure data integrity across the network. 

Built on a UTXO model, Vector should provide a robust and secure environment for transactions, offering a scalable and efficient platform for developers and businesses. 

## Features And Goals

- **Pure Rust**: The project is built entirely in Rust, offering memory safety without garbage collection, and concurrent execution for optimum performance.
- **gRPC (Protobuf)**: Google's high performance, open-source universal RPC framework is used for effective network communication.
- **UTXO Model**: The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model is used for transaction management, ensuring high levels of security and privacy.
- **Custom PBFT-like Consensus Mechanism**: My consensus mechanism, inspired by the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) model, guarantees data consistency and fault tolerance across the network. !(consensus mechanism was rejected due to its impracticality)
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale seamlessly, Vector should handle a growing number of transactions without compromising on speed or security.
